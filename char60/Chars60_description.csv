abr,Cumulative Abnormal Returns Around Earnings Announcement Dates,"We calculate cumulative abnormal stock return (Abr) around the latest quarterly earnings announcement date (Compustat quarterly item RDQ) (Chan, Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok 1996)): Abr_i = \sum_{d=-2}^{+1}r_{id}-r{md}, in which r id is stock i’s return on day d (with the earnings announced on day 0) and r md is the market index return. We cumulate returns until one (trading) day after the announcement date to account for the one-day-delayed reaction to earnings news. r md is the value-weighted market return for the Abr deciles with NYSE breakpoints and value-weighted returns, but is the equal-weighted market return with all-but-micro breakpoints and equal-weighted returns."
acc,Working capital accruals,Annual income before extraordinary items (ib) minus operating cash ﬂows (oancf ) divided by average total assets (at); if oancf is missing then set to change in act change in che - change in lct + change in dlc + change in txp-dp
adm,Advertising Expense-to-market,"At the end of June of each year t, we sort stocks into deciles based on advertising expenses-tomarket, Adm, which is advertising expenses (Compustat annual item XAD) for the ﬁscal year ending in calendar year t − 1 divided by the market equity (from CRSP) at the end of December of t − 1. For ﬁrms with more than one share class, we merge the market equity for all share classes before computing Adm. We keep only ﬁrms with positive advertising expenses. Monthly decile returns are calculated from July of year t to June of t + 1, and the deciles are rebalanced in June of t + 1. Because suﬃcient XAD data start in 1972, the Adm portfolios start in July 1973."
agr,Asset growth,Annual percent change in total assets (at)
alm,Asset liquidity (scaled by market assets),"Following Ortiz-Molina and Phillips (2014), we measure asset liquidity as cash + 0.75 × noncash current assets + 0.50 × tangible ﬁxed assets. Cash is cash and short-term investments (Compustat annual item CHE). Noncash current assets is current assets (item ACT) minus cash. Tangible ﬁxed assets is total assets (item AT) minus current assets (item ACT), minus goodwill (item GDWL, zero if missing), and minus intangibles (item INTAN, zero if missing).  Alm is asset liquidity scaled by one-year-lagged market value of assets. Market value of assets is total assets plus market equity (item PRCC F times item CSHO) minus book equity (item CEQ)."
ato,Asset turnover,"Noa is operating assets minus operating liabilities. Operating assets are total assets (item ATQ) minus cash and short-term investments (item CHEQ), and minus other investment and advances (item IVAOQ, zero if missing). Operating liabilities are total assets minus debt in current liabilities (item DLCQ, zero if missing), minus long-term debt (item DLTTQ, zero if missing), minus minority interests (item MIBQ, zero if missing), minus preferred stocks (item PSTKQ, zero if missing), and minus common equity (item CEQQ). Quarterly proﬁt margin, Pm q , is quarterly operating income after depreciation divided by quarterly sales (item SALEQ). Quarterly asset turnover, Ato q , is quarterly sales divided by one-quarter-lagged Noa."

ni,Net stock issues,"At the end of June of year t, we measure net stock issues, Nsi, as the natural log of the ratio of the split-adjusted shares outstanding at the ﬁscal year ending in calendar year t−1 to the split-adjusted shares outstanding at the ﬁscal year ending in t−2. The split-adjusted shares outstanding is shares outstanding (Compustat annual item CSHO) times the adjustment factor (item AJEX)."
nincr,Number of earnings increases,Number of consecutive quarters (up to eight quarters) with an increase in earnings (ibq) over same quarter in the prior year
noa,Net operating assets,"Following Hirshleifer, Hou, Teoh, and Zhang (2004), we measure net operating assets as operating assets minus operating liabilities. Operating assets are total assets (Compustat annual item AT) minus cash and short-term investment (item CHE). Operating liabilities are total assets minus debt included in current liabilities (item DLC, zero if missing), minus long-term debt (item DLTT, zero if missing), minus minority interests (item MIB, zero if missing), minus preferred stocks (item PSTK, zero if missing), and minus common equity (item CEQ). Noa is net operating assets scalded by one-year-lagged total assets."
op,Operating proﬁtability,"Following Fama and French (2015), we measure operating proﬁtability to equity, Ope, as total revenue (Compustat annual item REVT) minus cost of goods sold (item COGS, zero if missing), minus selling, general, and administrative expenses (item XSGA, zero if missing), and minus interest expense (item XINT, zero if missing), scaled by book equity (the denominator is current, not lagged, book equity). We require at least one of the three expense items (COGS, XSGA, and XINT) to be non-missing. Book equity is stockholders’ book equity, plus balance sheet deferred taxes and investment tax credit (item TXDITC) if available, minus the book value of preferred stock. Stockholders’ equity is the value reported by Compustat (item SEQ), if it is available. If not, we measure stockholders’ equity as the book value of common equity (item CEQ) plus the par value of preferred stock (item PSTK), or the book value of assets (item AT) minus total liabilities (item LT). Depending on availability, we use redemption (item PSTKRV), liquidating (item PSTKL), or par value (item PSTK) for the book value of preferred stock."
pctacc,Percent accruals,Same as acc except that the numerator is divided by the absolute value of ib; if ib = 0 then ib set to 0.01 for denominator.
pm,proﬁt margin,"Soliman (2008) use DuPont analysis to decompose Roe as Rna + FLEV × SPREAD, in which Roe is return on equity, Rna is return on net operating assets, FLEV is ﬁnancial leverage, and SPREAD is the diﬀerence between return on net operating assets and borrowing costs. We can further decompose Rna as Pm × Ato, in which Pm is proﬁt margin and Ato is asset turnover. Pm is operating income after depreciation divided by sales (item SALE) for the ﬁscal year ending in calendar year t − 1."

re,Revisions in analysts’ earnings forecasts,"Following Chan, Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok (1996), we measure earnings surprise as the revisions in analysts’ forecasts of earnings obtained from the Institutional Brokers’ Estimate System (IBES). Because analysts’ forecasts are not necessarily revised each month, we construct a six-month moving average of past changes in analysts’ forecasts: RE_{it}=\sum_{\iota=1}^6\frac{"
rna,return on net operating assets,"Following Soliman (2008), we use annual sorts to form Rna, Pm, and Ato deciles. At the end of June of year t, we measure Rna as operating income after depreciation (Compustat annual item OIADP) for the ﬁscal year ending in calendar year t − 1 divided by net operating assets (Noa) for the ﬁscal year ending in t − 2."
roa,Return on assets,"Return on assets, Roa, is income before extraordinary items (Compustat quarterly item IBQ) divided by one-quarter-lagged total assets (item ATQ). At the beginning of each month t, we sort all stocks into deciles based on Roa computed with quarterly earnings from the most recent earnings announcement dates (item RDQ). For a ﬁrm to enter the portfolio formation, we require the end of the ﬁscal quarter that corresponds to its most recent Roa to be within six months prior to the portfolio formation. This restriction is imposed to exclude stale earnings information. To avoid potentially erroneous records, we also require the earnings announcement date to be after the corresponding ﬁscal quarter end."
roe,Return on equity,"Return on equity, Roe, is income before extraordinary items (Compustat quarterly item IBQ) divided by one-quarter-lagged book equity (Hou, Xue, and Zhang 2015). Book equity is shareholders’ equity, plus balance sheet deferred taxes and investment tax credit (item TXDITCQ) if available, minus the book value of preferred stock (item PSTKQ). Depending on availability, we use stockholders’ equity (item SEQQ), or common equity (item CEQQ) plus the book value of preferred stock, or total assets (item ATQ) minus total liabilities (item LTQ) in that order as shareholders’ equity."
