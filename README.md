## Academic Background

For financial researches, we need equity characteristics. This repository is a toolkit to calculate asset characteristics in individual equity level and portfolio level.

Many papers contribute a lot to this repository. I am very sorry for only listing the following 4 papers.
- **Common risk factors in the returns on stocks and bonds** by [Fama and French 1993 JFE](https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-405X(93)90023-5)
- **A five-factor asset pricing model** by [Fama and French 2015 JFE](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2014.10.010)
  - [French's Data Library](http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html)
- **The Characteristics that Provide Independent Information about Average U.S. Monthly Stock Returns** by [Green Han Zhang 2017 RFS](https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhx019)
  - [sas code from Green's website](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwwEXkCgXEdRQWZreUpKOHBXOUU/view)
- **Replicating Anormalies** by [Hou Xue Zhang 2018 RFS](https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/hhy131)
  - [Anormaly Portfolios by Zhang's website](http://global-q.org/index.html)
